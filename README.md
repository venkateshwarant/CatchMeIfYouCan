# Catch me if you can

## Abstract
The development of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles, commonly known as UAVs or Drones have impacted our lives very much. Particularly in the recent times of COVID-19, it has been used in many surveillance applications. Moreover, UAVs are used across the world for commercial, civilian as well as military applications and government owned projects. Deciding upon the mobility of the UAVs have been a big issue in most of the applications. Here we consider upon the problem where we have two types of UAVs, one called defenders and the other intruders. The motive of the defender is to catch the intruder and of the intruder is to escape from the defender. The main objective of the defender is to minimize the catching time of intruders whereas intruder has to maximize the catching time. In this paper, we have developed and analyzed the mobility algorithms for both defender and intruder to move optimally in a confined space.
